An alien species' sex system is very bizarre in comparison with terrestrial ones. Perhaps it has two sexes that are not identifiable as either "male" or "female" in terrestrial terms, or perhaps it has three or more sexes, each of whom is indispensable for the species' reproduction process.
Of course, Earth has a few bizarre examples of its own. 
Some species of fungi have more than two sexes (although only two at a time are required for reproduction). 
There's a species of fish that only has one sex, and among seahorses, 
the male bears the children. But this only scratches the surface of what writers can imagine.
